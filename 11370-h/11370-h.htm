    <p>Who has journeyed on the Exeter road without noticing the town of STAINES, with
    its host of antiquarian associations&mdash;as the <i>Stana</i> (Saxon) or London
    Stone,<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a
    href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> its ancient bridge, for the repair of which three
    oaks out of Windsor Forest were granted by the crown in the year 1262, besides
    <i>pontage</i> or temporary tolls previous to the year 1600.&mdash;Dr. Stukeley's
    conjectures respecting the <i>Via Trinobantica</i> passing here&mdash;and the
    <i>old</i> parish church, the situation of which appeared to denote the site of the
    more ancient town of Staines. It is here too, that the tourist begins to imagine
    himself <i>in rure</i>, after he has been whirled through the brick and mortar
    avenues of <i>Kensington</i>, and <i>Hammersmith</i>, and the unsightly lane-street
    of <i>Brentford</i>,<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a
    href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> with all its cockney reminiscences of
    equestrianism and election squabbles; <i>Hounslow</i> and its by-gone days of highway
    notoriety and powder-mill and posting celebrity, and <i>Bedfont</i>, with its yew
    trees tortured into peacock shapes, and the date 1704. Then, who does not recollect
    and venerate the convivial celebrity of this route, its luxurious inns, and their
    "thrones of human felicity;" along which Quin, Dr. Johnson or Shenstone could
    scarcely have accomplished a stage a day!</p>

    <p>In our days, hundreds of London tourists breakfast at the <i>Bush</i>, although,
    after sixteen miles' ride, their appetites do not require this stimulant any more
    than do the glories of the <i>Bush</i> cellars after dinner.</p>

    <p>But we must pass on to the church. The <i>old</i> building was in the Gothic or
    pointed style, with lancet windows, &amp;c., but much disfigured by churchwardens'
    repairs, although the great Inigo Jones is said to have built its square, brick
    tower. At length, a considerable portion of this ancient structure fell in one Sunday
    morning, during the service, but, as the newspapers say, "fortunately no lives were
    lost." The inhabitants then resolved to rebuild nearly the whole, and the design of
    Mr. J.B. Watson was adopted. The foundation stone was laid March 31, in the present
    year, and the building is to be completed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page130"
    name="page130"></a>[pg 130]</span> by Christmas next. The church is intended to
    contain 1,100 persons. The length of the interior, 65 feet; width, 47 feet; height to
    ceiling, 25 feet. The chancel is to be rebuilt at the expense of the impropriators.
    The lower part of Inigo Jones's tower is to remain, and the whole is to be raised 23
    feet. These repairs, with the enclosure of the churchyard, will not exceed
    4,000<i>l</i>.; and the progress of the undertaking is highly creditable to the taste
    and execution of all the parties concerned.</p>

    <p>As one act of public spirit generally leads to another, the erection of a new
    stone bridge is projected at Staines; it is to be nearer the church than the present
    bridge, and will afford a better view of the new structure. An elegant stone bridge
    was erected here in 1796, but two of the piers sinking, the bridge was taken down,
    and an iron one substituted; this failed, and has since been supported by wooden
    piles and frame-work.</p>

    <h3>THE SPECTRE'S VOYAGE.</h3>

    <h4><i>(For the Mirror.)</i></h4>

    <p>"There is a part of the river Wye, between the city of Hereford and the town of
    Moss, which was distinguished and well known for upwards of two centuries, by the
    appellation of the Spectre's Voyage; across which, so long as it retained that name,
    neither entreaty nor remuneration could induce any boatman to convey passengers after
    a certain hour of the night. The superstitious ideas current amongst the lower orders
    of people were, that on every evening about the hour of eight, a beautiful female
    figure was seen in a small vessel, sailing from Hereford to Northrigg, (a small
    village about three miles distant,) with the utmost rapidity, against wind and tide,
    or even in a dead calm&mdash;landed at the little village, returned, and vanished,
    when arrived at a certain part of the river, where the current is remarkably strong,
    about half a mile from the city of Hereford."</p>

        <p class="i2">With sail, and oars, and mast.</p>

        <p>And in it sat the spectral form,</p>

        <p class="i2">Of a most beauteous maid;</p>

        <p>Who heeded neither wind nor storm,</p>

        <p class="i2">The scudding vessel goes;</p>

        <p>Or if so calm, the placid Wye,</p>

        <p class="i2">No wave was on its face,</p>

        <p>Yet onward did that light bark fly</p>

        <p>When on the deck she was espied,</p>

        <p class="i2">('Tis scarce believ'd when told)</p>

        <p class="i2">And swift the vessel flew;</p>

        <p>But where the man&mdash;who could abide</p>

        <p class="i2">But did that phantom fear.</p>

        <p>Or where's the man whose courage bold,</p>

    <h3>HARVEST HOME.</h3>

    <h4><i>(To the Editor of the Mirror.)</i></h4>

    <p>Sir,&mdash;Wishing to add to your numerous accounts of our local customs, I send
    you a description of the manner of celebrating harvest home in Westmoreland.</p>

    <p>The farmers of Appleby, Kirby, Thore, and many of the neighbouring and low towns
    thereabout, devote the last day of the harvest to mirth and festivity. The men
    generally endeavour to get the corn all in pretty early in the day; and at the last
    cart-load the horses are decked by the men with ears of corn and flowers and ribands;
    and then the lasses' straw- bonnets, who, in return, perform the same compliments on
    them. Thus they move on through the lanes and roads, till they reach the farm-yard,
    shouting, "Harvest Home," and singing songs in their way. When they reach the
    farm-yard, they set up an exulting shout, and ale is distributed to them by their
    master. About nine o'clock, a supper is prepared for them in their master's house. A
    wheat-sheaf is brought, and placed in the middle of the room, decorated with ribands
    and flowers, and corn is hung in various parts of the room. The supper mostly
    consists of some good old English dish, (of which there is plenty,) and the jolly
    farmer presides at the head of the table. After the cloth is cleared, liquor in
    abundance is brought forward, and the "president" sings, (not a <i>Non Nobis
    Domine</i>,) but a good, true, mirth-stirring song, and then the <i>fun</i>
    commences; singing and dancing alternately occupy the evening, and the bottle
    circulates speedily, and the festival generally breaks up about midnight.</p>

    <p>Thus, Mr. Editor, is harvest home spent in that county, and I send you the only
    account I can furnish of the harvest merriments, hoping some of your correspondents
    will add to my little mite.</p>

    <h3>MARCH OF "IMPROVEMENT."</h3>

    <h4><i>(For the Mirror.)</i></h4>

    <p>An old Subscriber has sent us the following <i>questions</i> on the improvement of
    the metropolis, which we insert as a castle-building <i>jeu d'esprit</i> rather than
    as a serious matter. They will, however, serve for the <i>committee of taste</i> to
    crack after dinner, and give a zest for their <i>magna bona</i>.</p>

    <p>Ought not the new palace to have been built in the richest Gothic style, so as to
    have deviated in appearance from every other edifice in the metropolis; and to have
    been erected on the north bank of the Serpentine?&mdash;And, if the <i>dome</i> of
    the present erection is not to be removed, cannot it be ornamented?&mdash;Or could
    not the pediment, fronting the park, be raised another story, so as to hide it (the
    dome) <span class="pagenum"><a id="page132" name="page132"></a>[pg 132]</span> from
    that side?&mdash;Indeed, would not the palace be much improved by such an alteration?
    I think if it be left as it is, when the wings are raised to the height of the body
    of the palace, (though they are a wonderful improvement upon those first erected) the
    whole will have a very flat appearance.&mdash;Are not the statues of Neptune,
    &amp;c., much too small, and the other ornaments, consisting of representations of
    warlike implements, &amp;c., much too heavy to look well?</p>

    <p>Is not the Borough a very improper place for the king's, or any other,
    college?&mdash;Is it not the very mart of trade, and consequently ever noisy and in
    confusion?&mdash;And what a magnificent improvement would its erection near
    Westminster Abbey be to that ancient and very sumptuous pile. Could it not be erected
    from Tothill Street, and extend towards Storey's Gate?&mdash;And should it not be
    built in the Gothic style to correspond with the abbey? The seat of learning and
    wisdom is in that neighbourhood (Westminster School, Houses of Parliament, Courts of
    Justice, &amp;c.); therefore it is the place best adapted for the erection of a
    college. Ought not also those disgraceful erections close to the abbey's western
    front, to be instantly removed?&mdash;And ought not the house of the dean, &amp;c. to
    be also rebuilt in the Gothic style, and extend from Tothill Street towards St.
    John's church? I never see this abbey (the glory of London) without feeling utterly
    disgusted at the surrounding objects. The great tower, also, should be erected in the
    same style as the other two. But should not the council office, and Somerset House,
    be finished before other works are begun?&mdash;Should not the interior of the dome
    of St. Paul's be repainted and gilt, and the windows (particularly the three over the
    altar) be of stained glass?&mdash;And should not the railing on the top of the dome
    on the outside (which is much decayed) be replaced by railing made of the new metal
    lately invented, which imitates brass, and does not tarnish?&mdash;Would not the
    entrance for the public, from Piccadilly into St. James's Park, be much better two or
    three yards from the new royal archway, as it will be very likely to be injured by
    people passing so near it?</p>

    <p>Would not a Swiss cottage and a Chinese temple very materially improve the
    appearance of the islands in St. James's Park; and two or three vessels upon that
    water, and the Serpentine in Hyde Park, also add very much to the effect?&mdash;Would
    a tower, surrounded by a railing, as the monument, and surmounted by a statue of
    George III. (looking with surprise to see what his son had done), or Canning, or
    Byron, be a proper sort of monument as a tribute to their memories; and to be erected
    in the centre of the Regent's Park? Oh! what a prospect would its summit command!
    Would not magnificent baths for males and females, erected on either side of Waterloo
    Place, and to be supplied from the new fountain, be a great addition to the beauty
    and comfort of this great city.</p>

    <p>These additions, alterations, and improvements, ought to be made now; and I doubt
    not, in the course of time, all warehouses will be removed from the banks of the
    Thames, above Blackfriars' Bridge, and that streets will run by the waterside as at
    Dublin. Also the time will come when the houses round St. Paul's will be pulled down
    and rebuilt in the Grecian style of architecture to correspond with the cathedral
    (the wonder of England), and be re-erected at a much greater distance from it.</p>

    <p>I would also ask, "should not the chimney pots upon the palaces in Regent Street,
    &amp;c. be of a slate colour?&mdash;Should not all tiles be painted of the same
    colour? (slate.)&mdash;Should not the names of streets be more particularly attended
    to?"</p>

    <h3>INTRODUCTION OF SILK INTO EUROPE.</h3>

    <h4><i>(For the Mirror.)</i></h4>

    <p>The frequency of open hostilities between the Emperor of Constantinople and the
    monarchs of Persia, together with the increasing rivalry of their subjects in the
    trade with India, gave rise to an event which produced a considerable change in the
    silk trade. As the use of that article, both in dress and furniture, became more
    general in the court of the Greek emperors, who imitated and surpassed the sovereigns
    of Asia in splendour and magnificence; and as China, in which, according to the
    concurring testimony of oriental writers, the culture of silk was originally known,
    <i>(Herlelot. Biblioth. Orient.)</i>, still continued to be the only country which
    produced that valuable commodity; the Persians improving the advantages which their
    situation gave them over the merchants from the Arabian Gulf, supplanted them in all
    the marts of India, to which silk was brought by sea from the east. Having it
    likewise in their power to molest or to cut off the caravans, which, in order to
    procure a supply for the Greek empire, travelled by land to China through the
    northern provinces of their kingdom, they entirely engrossed that branch of commerce.
    Constantinople was obliged to depend on the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page133"
    name="page133"></a>[pg 133]</span> rival power for an article which luxury reserved
    and desired as essential to elegance. The Persians, with the usual rapacity of
    monopolists, raised the price of silk to such an exorbitant height, that the Emperor
    Justinian eager, not only to obtain a full and certain supply of a commodity which
    was become of indispensible use, but solicitous to deliver the commerce of his
    subjects from the exactions of his enemies, endeavoured, by means of his ally, the
    christian monarch of Abyssinia, to wrest some portion of the silk trade from the
    Persians. In this attempt he failed; but when he least expected it, he, by an
    unforeseen event, attained in some measure (A.D. 55.) the object which he had in
    view. Two Persian monks having been employed as missionaries to some christian
    churches which were established (as we are informed by Cosmas) in different parts of
    India, had penetrated into the country of the Seres, or China. There they observed
    the labours of the silk-worm, and became acquainted with all the arts of men in
    working up its productions into such a variety of elegant fabrics. The prospect of
    gain, or perhaps an indignant zeal excited by seeing this lucrative branch of
    commerce engrossed by unbelieving nations, prompted them to repair to Constantinople.
    There they explained to the emperor the origin of silk, as well as the various modes
    of preparing and manufacturing it&mdash;mysteries hitherto unknown, or very
    imperfectly understood in Europe, and encouraged by his liberal promises, they
    undertook to bring to the capital a sufficient number of those wonderful insects to
    whose labours man is so much indebted. This they accomplished by conveying the eggs
    of the silk-worm in a hollow cane. They were hatched by the heat of a dunghill; fed
    with the leaves of a wild mulberry-tree, and they multiplied and worked in the same
    manner as in those climates where they first became objects of human attention and
    care. Vast numbers of these insects were soon reared in different parts of Greece,
    particularly in the Peloponnesus. Sicily afterwards undertook to breed silk-worms
    with equal success, and was imitated from time to time in several towns of Italy. In
    all these places extensive manufactures were established and carried on with silk of
    domestic production. The demand for silk from the East diminished, of course. The
    subjects of the Greek emperors were no longer obliged to have recourse to their
    enemies, the Persians, for a supply of it; and a considerable change took place in
    the nature of the commercial intercourse between Europe and India.</p>

    <p>Before the introduction of the silk-worm into Europe, and as often as its
    production is mentioned by the Greek and Roman authors, they had not, for several
    centuries after the use of it became common, any certain knowledge either of the
    countries to which they were indebted for this favourite article of elegance, or the
    manner in which it was produced, By some, silk was supposed to be a fine down
    adhering to the leaves of trees or flowers; others imagined it to be a delicate
    species of wool or cotton; and even those who had learned that it was the work of an
    insect, show by their description that they had no distinct idea of the manner in
    which it was formed. A circumstance concerning the traffic of silk among the Romans
    merits observation. Contrary to what usually takes place in the operations of trade,
    the more general use of that commodity seems not to have increased the quantity
    imported in such proportion as to answer the growing demand for it; and the price of
    silk was not reduced during the course of 250 years from the time of its being first
    known in Rome. In the reign of Aurelian it still continued to be valued at its weight
    in gold. (See Robertson's <i>History of India</i>.)</p>

    <p>It is a singular circumstance in the history of silk, that, on account of its
    being an exertion of a worm, the Mahomedans consider it as an unclean dress, and it
    has been decided with the unanimous assent of all their doctors, that a person
    wearing a garment made entirely of silk cannot lawfully offer up the daily prayers
    enjoined by the Koran. <i>(Herbel. Bibl. Orient.)</i> C.V.</p>

    <h3>LADIES' FASHIONS.</h3>

    <h4><i>(To the Editor of the Mirror.)</i></h4>

    <p>If you think the following observations conformable to the plan of your useful and
    entertaining publication, perhaps you may be induced to give them a place, or notice
    the subject I have in view, in some other way.</p>

    <p>Notwithstanding the host of publications periodically issuing from the press,
    independent of the incalculable list of newspapers and reviews; and though the rage
    for periodicals is so great, that a single event will give rise to one, yet there
    does not appear to me to be any thing like those works which used to amuse and
    instruct our great grandfathers. I mean the "Spectator," "Tatler," and others, whose
    influence extends to the present day, and which are continually affording pleasure to
    cultivated minds by the soundness of their doctrines, <span class="pagenum"><a
    id="page134" name="page134"></a>[pg 134]</span> aided by the extensive knowledge of
    human nature that the authors display throughout. But as they are now become standard
    works, they are not so capable of "shooting folly as it flies," and being as it were
    aged in the service, can only have a proper effect when folly will stand still to
    listen to them; but as that is, in most instances, out of the question, we want
    something more active, or in other words, something new; and novelty being the order
    of the day, attention is thereby excited, and the follies and extravagances of the
    "age," may possibly have some advantageous pruning.</p>

    <p>Caricatures, whether exhibited in pantomimes or print shops, (though often got up
    for any other purpose than instruction) are not sufficient; they are too ridiculous,
    though sometimes not devoid of humour, instance the picture of a lady striving
    ineffectually to make a way through Temple Bar, but is prevented by the enormous size
    of her bonnet, which shows likewise that this extravagance in dress is not confined
    to the west end. But as these things are only laughed at, some other means ought to
    be adopted; and I should think myself extremely fortunate if I could be the humble
    means of inducing you, or your correspondents, to take the matter in hand.</p>

    <p>Certainly not the least to be deprecated are the "ladies' present dresses;" the
    extravagances of which are not confined to the head, but are exhibited also all down
    the arm (not unaptly likened to series of balloons) and are also, in most instances,
    by some unusual "bustling," equally absurd. I wonder what would be said by Mr.
    Addison, were he to witness the present fashions. He would certainly think that all
    the care he took to keep the fair sex in order was in vain; and though enormous head
    dresses were not in vogue in his time, he seems to have anticipated that they would
    be, by his recommending the perusal of his 98th paper of the "Spectator" to his
    female readers by way of prevention, but which, alas! has not been studied with the
    attention it merits. Probably the transcription of one passage will not be misapplied
    here:&mdash;</p>

    <p>He says, "I would desire the fair sex to consider how impossible it is for them to
    add any thing that can be ornamental to what is already the masterpiece of nature.
    The head has the most beautiful appearance, as well as the highest station, in a
    human figure. Nature has laid out all her art in beautifying the face; she has
    touched it with vermilion, planted in it a double row of ivory, made it the seat of
    smiles and blushes, lighted it up and enlivened it with the brightness of the eyes,
    hung it on each side with curious organs of sense, given it airs and graces that
    cannot be described, and surrounded it with such a flowing shade of hair as sets all
    its beauties in the most agreeable light. In short she seems to have designed the
    head as the cupola to the most glorious of her works; and when we load it with such a
    pile of supernumerary ornaments, we destroy the symmetry of the human figure, and
    foolishly contrive to call off the eye from great and real beauties to childish
    gew-gaws, ribbons, and bone-lace."</p>

    <p>Womankind, Mr. Editor, I do not believe, are naturally vain; but as they were made
    for us and for our comfort, it is natural that they should endeavour to gain our
    esteem; but they carry their endeavours too far; by straining to excite attention
    they overstep the mark, become vain and coquetish, one strives to outdo another,
    others say they must do as other women do, and they thus make themselves ridiculous
    unknowingly. It is really painful to see a woman of sense and education become a
    slave to the tyranny of fashion&mdash;and injuring both body and mind&mdash;and it
    is, I think, an insult to a man of understanding to endeavour to excite his attention
    by any such peculiarities.</p>

    <p>Having now generally stated the subject that I should wish to be taken up by abler
    hands than mine, I will conclude by recommending all your town-bred, and coquetish
    ladies to study and restudy a letter signed "Mary Home," in No. 254 of the excellent
    work before alluded to, "The Spectator." &mdash;H.M&mdash;. <i>Great Surrey Street,

    <h3>HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF SMITHFIELD.</h3>

    <h4><i>(For the Mirror.)</i></h4>

    <p>Stowe, in his "Survey of London," 1633, says, "Then is Smithfield Pond, which of
    (old time) in records was called Horsepoole, for that men watered horses there, and
    was a great water. In the 6th of Henry V. a new building was made in the west part of
    Smithfield, betwixt the said poole and the river of Wels, or Turne-mill-brooke, in a
    place then called the Elms, for that there grew many elme-trees, and this had been
    the place of execution for offenders. Since the which time, the building there hath
    been so increased, that now remaineth not one tree growing. In the yeere 1357, the
    31st of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page135" name="page135"></a>[pg 135]</span>
    Edward III., great and royall justs were then holden in Smithfield, there being
    present the kings of England, France, and Scotland, with many other nobles, and great
    estates of divers lands. In the yeere 1362, the 36th of Edward III., on the first
    five daies of May, in Smithfield, were justs holden, the king and queene being
    present, with the most part of the chivalry of England and of France and of other
    nations; to which came Spaniards, Cyprians, and Armenians, knightly requesting ayde
    of the king of England against the Pagans, that invaded their confines. The 48th of
    Edward III., Dame Alice Perrers, or Pierce, (the king's concubine,) as lady of the
    Sunne, rode from the Tower of London through Cheape, accompanied of many lords and
    ladies, every lady leading a lord by his horse bridle, till they came into West
    Smithfield, and then began a great just, which endured seven daies after.&mdash;In
    the 14th of Richard II., royal justs and turnements were proclaimed to be done in
    Smithfield, to begin on Sunday next, after the feast of Saint Michael; many strangers
    came forth of other countries, namely, Valarian, Earle of St. Paul, that had married
    King Richard's sister, the Lady Maud Courtney; and William, the young Earle of
    Ostervant, son to Albert of Baviere, Earle of Holland and Henault. At the day
    appointed, there issued forth at the Tower, about the third houre of the day, 60
    coursers, apparelled for the justs, upon every one an esquire of honour riding a soft
    pace; then came forth 60 ladies of honour, mounted upon palfraies, riding on the one
    side, richly apparelled, and every lady led a knight with a chain of gold; those
    knights, being on the king's party, had their armour and apparell garnished with
    white harts, and crownes of gold about the harts' neckes; and so they came riding
    through the streets of London to Smithfield, with a great number of trumpets, &amp;c.
    The kinge and the queene, who were lodged in the bishop's palace of London, were come
    from thence, with many great estates, and placed in chambers, to see the justs. The
    ladies that led the knights were taken down from their palfraies, and went up to
    chambers prepared for them. Then alighted the esquires of honour from their coursers,
    and the knights in good order mounted upon them; and after their helmets were set on
    their heads, and being ready in all points, proclamation made by the heralds, the
    justs began, and many commendable courses were runne, to the great pleasure of the
    beholders. The justs continued many days with great feastings, as ye may reade in
    <i>Froisard</i>," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

    <p>Smithfield, says Pennant, "was also the spot on which accusations were decided by
    duel, derived from the Kamp-fight ordeal of the Saxons. I will only (says Mr. P.)
    mention an instance. It was when the unfortunate armourer entered into the lists, on
    account of a false accusation of treason, brought against him by his apprentice, in
    the reign of Henry VI. The friends of the defendant had so plied him with liquor,
    that he fell an easy conquest to his accuser. Shakspeare has worked this piece of
    history into a scene, in the second part of <i>Henry VI</i>., but has made the poor
    armourer confess his treasons in his dying moments; for in the time in which this
    custom prevailed, it never was even suspected but that guilt must have been the
    portion of the vanquished. When people of rank fought with sword and lance, plebeian
    combatants were only allowed a pole, armed with a heavy sand-bag, with which they
    were to decide their guilt or innocence. In Smithfield were also held our
    autos-de-fee; but to the credit of our English monarchs, none were ever known to
    attend the ceremony. Even Philip II. of Spain never honoured any, of the many which
    were celebrated by permission of his gentle queen, with his presence, notwithstanding
    he could behold the roasting of his own subjects with infinite self-applause and
    <i>sang-froid</i>. The stone marks the spot, in this area, on which those cruel
    exhibitions were executed. Here our martyr <i>Latimer</i> preached patience to friar
    <i>Forest</i>, agonizing under the torture of a slow fire, for denying the king's
    supremacy; and to this place our martyr <i>Cranmer</i> compelled the amiable
    <i>Edward</i>, by forcing his reluctant hand to the warrant, to send <i>Joan
    Bocher</i>, a silly woman, to the stake. Yet <i>Latimer</i> never thought of his own
    conduct in his last moments; nor did <i>Cranmer</i> thrust his hand into the fire for
    a real crime, but for one which was venial, through the frailty of human nature. Our
    gracious Elizabeth could likewise burn people for religion. Two Dutchmen,
    Anabaptists, suffered in this place in 1675, and died, as Holinshed sagely remarks,
    with "roring and crieing." But let me say, (says Pennant,) that this was the only
    instance we have of her exerting the blessed prerogative of the writ <i>De Haeretico
    comburendo</i>. Her highness preferred the halter; her sullen sister faggot and fire.
    Not that we will deny but Elizabeth made a very free use of the terrible act of her
    27th year. One hundred and sixty-eight suffered in her reign, at London, York, in
    Lancashire, and several other parts of the kingdom, convicted of being priests, <span
    class="pagenum"><a id="page136" name="page136"></a>[pg 136]</span> of harbouring
    priests, or of becoming converts. But still there is a balance of 109 against us in
    the article persecution, and that by the agonizing death of fire; for the smallest
    number estimated to have suffered under the savage Mary, amounts, in her short reign,
    to 277. The last person who suffered at the stake in England was Bartholomew Logatt,
    who was burnt here in 1611, as a blasphemous heretic, according to the sentence
    pronounced by John King, bishop of London. The bishop consigned him to the secular of
    our monarch James, who took care to give the sentence full effect. This place, as
    well as Tybourn, was called <i>The Elms</i>, and used for the execution of
    malefactors even before the year 1219. In the year 1530, there was a most severe and
    singular punishment inflicted here on one John Roose, a cook, who had poisoned 17
    persons of the Bishop of Rochester's family, two of whom died, and the rest never
    recovered their health. His design was against the pious prelate Fisher, who at that
    time resided at Rochesterplace, Lambeth. The villain was acquainted with the cook,
    and, coming into the bishop's kitchen, took an opportunity, while the cook's back was
    turned to fetch him some drink, to fling a great quantity of poison into the gruel,
    which was prepared for dinner for the bishop's family, and the poor of the parish.
    The good bishop escaped. Fortunately, he that day abstained from food. The humility
    and temperance of that good man are strongly marked in this relation, for he partook
    of the same ordinary food with the most wretched pauper. By a retrospective law,
    Roose was sentenced to be boiled to death, which was done accordingly. In Smithfield,
    the arch-rebel, Wat Tyler, met with, in 1381, the reward of his treason and
    insolence."</p>

    <h2>THE ANECDOTE GALLERY.</h2>
    <hr />

    <h3>THE ANDALUSIAN ASS.</h3>

    <p>A gay lieutenant of the Spanish Royal Guards, known by the name of Alonzo Beldia,
    became violently enamoured of the beautiful Carlotta Pena, the eldest daughter of a
    reputable gunsmith, whose humble habitation adjoined the vast cemetery of Valencia,
    and whom Beldia had casually seen at a public entertainment given in that good
    city.</p>

    <p>Alonzo was affable and extremely complaisant, though an egotist and somewhat
    loquacious; but nature had, nevertheless, bestowed upon him a prepossessing exterior
    with an enviable pair of jet black whiskers, and the most expressive eyes; he could
    sing a <i>tonadilla</i> divinely; dance the <i>fandango</i> with inimitable grace;
    and "strike the light guitar" with unparalleled mastery. He was, in truth, an
    accomplished man of pleasure, and by his gallantry he subdued the tender hearts of
    many fair daughters of Ferdinand's domains.</p>

    <p>On a dark night in the month of December, just as Alonzo had played one of his
    bewitching airs, with his wonted execution, and was engaged, in converse sweet, with
    the enraptured Carlotta, an extraordinary and seemingly supernatural noise suddenly
    proceeded from a distant part of the hallowed ground where Alonzo sacrificed at the
    shrine of love. Jesu Maria! exclaimed the terrified damsel, what, in the name of
    heaven, can it be? ere the silvery tones of her sweet voice had reached the ears of
    the petrified Alonzo, the "iron tongue" of the cathedral clock announced the hour of
    midnight, and the solemn intonation of its prodigious bell instilled new horrors into
    the confused minds of the affrighted lovers. The brave, the royal Alonzo heard not
    the voice of his enchanting dulcinea; he, poor fellow, with difficulty supported his
    trembling frame against an ancient <i>memento mori</i>, which reared its tristful
    crest within a whisper of the lattice of the lovely Carlotta. Large globules of
    transparent liquid adorned his pallid brow, and his convulsed knees sought each other
    with mechanical solicitude. It was a moment pregnant with the gravest misery to poor
    Alonzo; not a star was seen to enliven the murky night, and the wind whistled most
    lugubriously. He was in a state of insensibility, and would have fallen to the cold
    earth, but luckily for the valiant youth, the melodious voice of the enchanting girl
    again breathed the tenderest hopes for the safety of her adored Alonzo. He sprang
    upon his legs and drew a pistol from his girdle, which he discharged with unerring
    aim at the dreaded goblin. A horrible groan followed this murderous act, which was
    succeeded by a confused noise, and a solemn silence ensued! "It's vanished, Carlotta!
    I have hurried the intruding demon to the nether world!" exclaimed the valorous
    guardsman. "Heavens be praised," cried the superstitious girl, <span

    love&mdash;quit this spot directly&mdash;my father has alarmed his people&mdash;away,
    away!"</p>

    <p>The worthy maker of guns approached the scene of carnage, accompanied by the
    inmates of his dwelling, with rueful countenances, illumined by tapers, when the
    cause of their disquietude was soon discovered. No apparition or sprite forsooth, but
    a full grown <i>donkey</i> of the Andalusian breed, lay weltering in gore, yet warm
    with partial life! By timely liberality the valorous Alonzo escaped detection, though
    the heroic deed is still remembered in merry Valencia, and often cited as an instance
    of glorious (?) <i>chivalry</i>.</p>

    <h3>IMPROVED SAFETY LAMP.</h3>

    </div>

    <p>Mr. Dillon has lately introduced to the notice of the scientific world, an
    improvement upon the <i>Safety Lamp</i> of Sir Humphry Davy, which appears to us of
    sufficient interest for illustration in our columns. As the <i>Davy Lamp</i> is too
    well known to need special description here, it will be merely necessary to allude to
    the principle of the invention, in order to point out Mr. Dillon's improvement.</p>

    <p>He maintains, in opposition to Sir Humphry Davy, that the Davy lamp acts by its
    heat and rarefaction, and not from Sir H. Davy's theory, that flame is cooled by a
    wire-gauze covering. He shows, by a simple experiment, that the Davy lamp is not safe
    in a current of hydrogen or carburetted hydrogen gas, and that many lives may have
    been lost from the confidence of miners in its perfect safety. A current of hydrogen
    or carburetted hydrogen gas steadily directed on the flame of the lamp from a bladder
    and stopcock, <i>by cooling the wire gauze</i>, brings the flame of the lamp through
    the gauze to the mouth of the stopcock, (even should there be six folds of gauze
    intervening.) He shows also, by immersing the lamp, when cold and newly lighted, into
    a jar of dense hydrogen or carburetted hydrogen gas, or an explosive mixture with
    atmospheric air, that explosion takes place inside and outside of the lamp; whereas,
    when the lamp has burnt sufficiently long to heat the wire gauze, no explosion takes
    place on the outside of the lamp. These experiments appear incontrovertible in
    support of his theory, which is, "<i>that the wire gauze is merely the rapid receiver
    and the retainer of heat, and that it is the caloric in its meshes which prevents the
    flame of the lamp from being fed by the oxygen of the atmosphere on the
    outside</i>."</p>

    <p>The experiments of Libri, showing that flame is inflected by metallic rods, and
    that "when two flames are made to approach each other, there is a mutual repulsion,
    although their proximity increases the temperature of each, instead of diminishing
    it," support Mr. Dillon's theory&mdash;the inflection being occasioned by the
    rarefaction of the air between the rod and the flame, the latter seeking for oxygen
    to support it in a denser medium, the two flames repelling each other for the same
    reason, and not from any mysterious and "repulsive effect of the wires of the gauze
    tissue." Mr. Dillon increases the heat of the lamp, and places on it a shield of talc
    to protect it from a current, and, upon his theory, the shafts or workings of iron
    and coal mines may be lighted with gas with perfect safety, protecting the flame with
    wire gauze and a circular shield of talc.</p>

    <h2>THE SELECTOR; AND LITERARY NOTICES OF <i>NEW WORKS</i>.</h2>
    <hr />

    <h4>PENELOPE, OR LOVE'S LABOUR LOST.</h4>

    <p>This is one of the most deservedly attractive novels of the past season; and the
    good sense with which it abounds, ought to insure it extensive circulation. It has
    none of the affectation or presumptuousness of "fashionable" literature; but is at
    once a rational picture of that order of society to which its characters belong, and
    a just satire on the <i>superior</i> vices of the wealthy and the great. The author
    is evidently no servile respecter of either of the latter classes, for which reason,
    his work is the more estimable, and is a picture of <i>real</i> life, whereas fashion
    at best lends but a disguise, or artificial colouring to the actions of men, and thus
    renders them the less important to the world, and less to be depended on as scenes
    and portraitures of human character. The former will, however, stand as lasting
    records of the men and manners of the age in which they were drawn, whilst the
    latter, being in their own day but caricatures of life, will, in course of time, fade
    and lose their interest, and at length become levelled with the mere ephemera, or
    day-flies of literature. It is true that novel-writing has, within the last sixteen,
    or eighteen years, attained a much higher rank than it hitherto enjoyed; but it
    should be remembered that this superiority has not been grounded in mawkish records
    of the fashionable follies of high life, such as my Lord Duke, or my Lady Bab, might
    indite below stairs, for the amusement of those in the drawing-room; on the contrary,
    it was founded in portraits and pictures of human nature, strengthened by historical,
    or matter-of-fact interest, and stripped of the trickery of fancy and romance;
    whereas, the chronicles of fashion are little better than the vagaries of an
    eccentric few, who bear the same proportion to the general mass of society, that the
    princes, heroes, and statesmen of history do to the whole world. This is a fallacy of
    which thousands of Bath and Cheltenham novel-readers are not yet aware, and which the
    listless <i>Dangles</i> of Brighton and Margate have yet to learn, ere they can hope
    to arrive at a correct estimate of human nature; but to such readers we cordially
    recommend <i>Penelope</i> as the best corrective we can prescribe for the bile of
    fashionable prejudice, or the nausea arising from overstrained fiction, modified as
    it is to the romance of real life.</p>

    <p><i>Penelope</i> has, however, one of the failings common to fashionable novels.
    Its plot is weak and meagre&mdash;but it is still simple and natural, and has not
    borrowed any of those adventitious aids to which we have alluded above. It bears
    throughout an air of probability, untinctured by romance, and has the strong impress
    of truth and fidelity to nature. Sketchy and vivacious, always humorous and sometimes
    witty; it has many scenes and portraits, which in terseness and energy, will compare
    with any of its predecessors; and occasionally there are touches of genuine sentiment
    which seize on the sympathies of the reader with more than common effect. The
    incidents of the narrative do not present many opportunities for these displays of
    the writer's talent, and we cannot refrain from thinking that their more frequent
    introduction would have increased the success of the work&mdash;that is, if we may be
    allowed to judge from the specimens with which the author has here favoured us.</p>

    <p>But we are getting somewhat too critical, and consequently as much out of our
    element as modern aeronauts, who are no sooner in the air than they seem to think of
    their descent. We shall not, however, impair the pleasure of the reader by giving him
    a foretaste of the whole plot of <i>Penelope</i>; but we shall rather confine
    ourselves to a few portrait-specimens of characters, whose <i>drawing</i> will, we
    hope, <i>attract</i> the general reader; presuming, as we do, that its claims to his
    attention will be found to outweigh dozens of the scandalous chronicles of high
    fashion. We are not told whether the parties ate with silver or steel forks, or
    burned wax or tallow; but those characters must be indeed poorly drawn which do not
    enable the reader to satisfy himself about such trifles, allowing that he thinks them
    worth his study.</p>

    <p>An outline of the characters may not be unacceptable. The scene lies principally
    in the villages of Neverden and Smatterton; and between their rectors Dr. Greendale
    and Mr. Darnley, and their families; the Earl of Smatterton, of Smatterton Hall; Lord
    Spoonbill, his son; Sir George Aimwell, of Neverden Hall; <i>Penelope Primrose</i>,
    the heroine, who is placed by her father under the care of Dr. Greendale, whilst Mr.
    Primrose seeks to repair his fortune in the Indies; and Robert Darnley, Penelope's
    suitor, also for sometime in the Indies, who is thwarted in his views by Lord
    Spoonbill, and a creature named colonel Crop, &amp;c.</p>

    <p>In the early part of the narrative, Dr. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page139"
    name="page139"></a>[pg 139]</span> Greendale dies, and Penelope is removed from
    Smatterton to London, where she is to be brought out as a singer, under the patronage
    of the Countess of Smatterton, and Spoonbill is first struck with her charms, and
    resolves to frustrate his absent rival.</p>

    <p>The roguery of a postboy named Nick Muggins, who is employed by the noble suitor
    to intercept letters, and the aid of Crop, who acts as a sort of go-between, are put
    in requisition for this purpose; but the villany of the latter is finely defeated in
    his mistaking a silly, forward girl, Miss Glossop, for Penelope, and accordingly
    prevailing on her to elope with him to Lord Spoonbill's villa, where the blunder is
    soon discovered by his lordship, who in return is horsewhipped by the father of Miss
    Glossop; and Darnley and Penelope are eventually married.</p>

    <p>There are two or three adjuncts, as Peter Kipperson, a "march of intellect" man,
    Erpingham, one of Spoonbill's companions in debauchery, Ellen Fitzpatrick, one of his
    victims, Dr. Greendale's successor, Charles Pringle; and Zephaniah Pringle, a
    literary coxcomb of the first order.</p>

    <p>The portrait of Dr. Greendale is of high finish&mdash;full of the truth and
    amiability of the Christian character&mdash;one who regarded the false distinctions
    of society in their proper light, and knew how to set a right value upon the
    influence of good example, and who was "loved and respected for the steadiness and
    respectability of his character; for the integrity, purity, simplicity, and sincerity
    of his life." At the same time, the doctor is finely contrasted with his wife, who
    possessed the common failing of paying homage to her illustrious neighbours to obtain
    their notice and patronage, and who felt flattered by a collateral branch of the
    Smattertons accepting an invitation to her table. Of the <i>heroine</i>, we quote the
    author's outline:&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Penelope Primrose</i> exceeded the middle stature, that her dark blue eyes were
    shaded by a deep and graceful fringe, that her complexion was somewhat too pale for
    beauty, but that its paleness was not perceptible as a defect whenever a smile
    illumined her countenance, and developed the dimples that lurked in her cheek and
    underlip. Her features were regular, her gait exceedingly graceful, and her voice
    musical in the highest degree. Seldom, indeed, would she indulge in the pleasure of
    vocal music, but when she did, as was sometimes the case to please the Countess of
    Smatterton, her ladyship, who was a most excellent judge, used invariably to
    pronounce Miss Primrose as the finest and purest singer that she had ever heard.</p>

    <p>The character of Lord Spoonbill is struck out with singular felicity and
    spirit:&mdash;</p>

    <p>Lord Spoonbill was not one of those careless young men who lose at the university
    what they have gained at school; one reason was, that he had little or nothing to
    lose; nor was his lordship one of those foolish people who go to a university and
    study hard to acquire languages which they never use, and sciences which they never
    apply in after-life. His lordship had sense enough to conclude that, as the nobility
    do not talk Greek, he had no occasion to learn it; and as hereditary legislators have
    nothing to do with the exact sciences, it would be a piece of idle impertinence in
    him to study mathematics. But his lordship had heard that hereditary legislators did
    occasionally indulge in other pursuits, and for those pursuits he took especial care
    to qualify himself. In his lordship's cranium, the organ of exclusiveness was
    strongly developed. We do not mean that his head was so constructed internally, as to
    exclude all useful furniture, but that he had a strong sense of the grandeur of
    nobility and the inseparable dignity which attaches itself to the privileged orders.
    The only instances in which he condescended to persons in inferior rank, were when he
    was engaged at the race-course at Newmarket, or when he found that condescension
    might enable him to fleece some play-loving plebeian, or when affairs of gallantry
    were concerned. In these matters no one could be more condescending than Lord
    Spoonbill. We should leave but an imperfect impression on the minds of our readers if
    we should omit to speak of his lordship's outward and visible form. This was an
    essential part of himself which he never neglected or forgot; and it should not be
    neglected or forgotten by his historian. He was tall and slender, his face was long,
    pale and thin, his forehead was narrow, his eyes large and dull, his nose aquiline,
    his mouth wide, his teeth beautifully white and well formed, and displayed far more
    liberally than many exhibitions in the metropolis which are only "open from ten till
    dusk." His lips were thin, but his whiskers were tremendously thick. Of his person he
    was naturally and justly proud. Who ever possessed such a person and was not proud of
    it?</p>

    <p><i>Colonel Crop</i> was only Colonel Crop; he enjoyed the rank of colonel, and
    that was all the rank that he could boast; he was tolerated at the castle; he dined
    occasionally with his lordship; and occasionally <span class="pagenum"><a
    id="page140" name="page140"></a>[pg 140]</span> partook of the pleasure of shooting
    the birds which were cultivated on his lordship's estate. In town, he patronised the
    countess' routs, and in the country he was a companion for the earl, when not
    otherwise engaged. He was proud of the earl's acquaintance, though he was not weak
    enough to suppose that he was more than tolerated. The haughtiest of the great do
    sometimes pick up such acquaintances as Colonel Crop, and they cannot easily get rid
    of them.</p>

    <p>We must pass over Peter Kipperson, an excellent whole-length portrait of a man who
    makes a noise in these marching times, and show in <i>Sir George Aimwell</i>, of
    Neverden Hall, Bart., who was descended from a long line of illustrious ancestry, and
    was a wholesale poulterer, and one of the great unpaid. Not that we mean by this
    expression to insinuate that the retail poulterers did not pay him for what they had:
    we merely mean to say, that the preserve-worshiping, springgun-setting,
    poacher-committing baronet administered justice for nothing; and with reverence be it
    spoken, that was quite as much as it was worth. The worthy baronet was a most active
    magistrate, peculiarly acute in matters of summary conviction; and thinking it a
    great pity that any rogue should escape, or that any accused, but honest man, should
    lose an opportunity of clearing his character by means of a jury of his
    fellow-countrymen, he never failed to commit all that were brought before him.</p>

    <p>Sir George professed Whig politics; these were hereditary in his family, but by no
    means constitutional in him as an individual. Therefore he passed for a very moderate
    Whig; for one who would not clog the wheels of government. In short, he was no more a
    Whig than a game preserver ought to be; and that, as our readers know, is not much.
    He took especial pains to keep the parish clear of vagrants and paupers; and by his
    great activity he kept down the poor-rates to a moderate sum. Sir George, though a
    professed Whig, was not very partial to the education of the lower orders, and he
    always expressed himself well pleased when he met with a country booby who could
    neither read nor write. For this reason Nick Muggins, the postboy, was a great
    favourite with him. Our worthy baronet could not see the use of reading, and he
    thought it a great piece of affectation for country gentlemen to have libraries. His
    own books, for he had a few, were huddled together in a light closet, where he kept
    his guns and sporting tackle. There was a Lady Aimwell, wife to Sir George; but this
    lady was a piece of still life, of whom the neighbours knew nothing, and for whom her
    husband cared nothing.</p>

    <p>Everybody in the neighbourhood remembers the impressive admonition which Sir
    George gave to an old man who was convicted at the quarter sessions of having a bit
    of string in his pocket, and therefore strongly suspected of a design of a malicious
    nature against the game.</p>

    <p>"John Carter," said the worthy baronet, "let me address to you a few words on the
    sin of poaching. Poaching, John Carter&mdash;is&mdash;is a sin of which too many are
    guilty, owing to the lenity of our most excellent laws. I think that if everybody
    thought, as I think, of the moral heinousness of this offence, nobody would be guilty
    of it. Poaching is not yet made felony; but there is no saying how soon it may be
    made so, if the crime be persisted in. It is a moral offence of the greatest
    enormity, and is one of those crying, national sins, which may one day or other bring
    down the vengeance of heaven on our guilty country. Now, John Carter, if you go to
    gaol for six months, I hope the tread-mill and the chaplain will work a thorough
    reformation in your morals."</p>

    <p>Of course the contact of Sir George with such a man as Kipperson, affords great
    merriment: <i>ex. gr.</i> part of a dinner scene at Neverden Hall:&mdash;</p>

    <p>Now Peter was a very literary man, who thought there was nothing worth living for
    but science and literature; and having somewhere read that it was impossible to take
    shelter in a shower of rain with such a man as Burke, without discovering him to be a
    man of genius, Peter was desirous of continually showing off, and was instant in
    season and out of season. Therefore when sitting at the table of the worthy baronet,
    he assailed the magistrate with various scientific subjects, but all to no purpose;
    there was no response from his worthy host. Endeavouring to adapt himself to the
    moderate talents and circumscribed reading of the baronet, he next started the
    subject of novels and novel reading, taking care to insinuate that, though Sir George
    might not read the trash of circulating libraries, he might be acquainted with some
    of our best novels. To this at last the baronet replied&mdash;"Oh, yes; I remember
    many years ago reading a novel called Tom Jones, written by a Bow Street officer. I
    recollect something about it&mdash;it was very low stuff&mdash;I forget the
    particulars, but it was written in the manner of servants."</p>

    <p>Hereupon Mr. Peter Kipperson set it down as an indisputable fact that baronets and
    magistrates were the most ignorant creatures on the face of the earth, and he <span
    class="pagenum"><a id="page141" name="page141"></a>[pg 141]</span> congratulated
    himself that neither he nor Sir Isaac Newton were baronets.</p>

    <p>A scene between Lord Spoonbill and one of his victims, whom he meets in his
    father's park, has some fine touches of remorse:&mdash;</p>

    <p>Agitated by distracting thoughts, he stood at the park gate, gazing alternately in
    different directions; and by the intensity of his feelings was at last rivetted in an
    almost unconscious state of mind to the spot on which he was standing. Suddenly his
    pulse beat quicker, and his heart seemed to swell within him, when at a little
    distance he saw the dreaded one approaching him. Had he seen her anywhere else his
    first impulse would have been to avoid her; but here his truest and best policy was
    to submit to an interview, however painful. Shall he meet her with kindness?&mdash;
    Shall he meet her with reproaches?&mdash;Shall he meet her with coldness? These were
    inquiries rapidly passing through his mind as she drew nearer and nearer. It was
    difficult for him to decide between cruelty and hypocrisy; but the last was the most
    natural to him, so far as custom is a second nature.</p>

    <p>The afflicted one moved slowly with her eyes fixed on the ground, and she saw not
    her enemy till so near to him, that on lifting up her face and recognising his
    well-known features, the sudden shock produced a slight hysteric shriek.</p>

    <p>Lord Spoonbill was not so lost to all feeling of humanity as to be insensible to
    the anguish of mind which she now suffered, who had once regarded him as a friend,
    and had loved him, "not wisely, but too well." He held out his hand to her with an
    unpremeditated look of kindness and affection; and which, being unpremeditated, bore
    the aspect of sincerity. The stranger at first hesitated, and seemed not disposed to
    accept the offered hand; but she looked up in his face, and the blood mounted to her
    cheeks and the tears stood in her eyes, and she gave him her hand, and covered her
    face and wept bitterly.</p>

    <p>There are moments in which shameless profligates look foolish and feel that they
    are contemptible. This was such a moment to Lord Spoonbill. He was moved, and he was
    mortified that he was moved; and there was a general feeling of confusion and
    perplexity in his mind. What could he say? or how could he act? He began to stammer
    out something like gentleness, and something like reproof. But she who stood before
    him was as an accusing spirit, to whom apology was mockery, and repentance too
    late.</p>

    <p>In the first volume too, there is a successful satire on the changes of sixteen
    years in the condition of the people of England&mdash;between Mr. Primrose, who had
    been absent for that period, and the egregious Peter Kipperson. It is quite in the
    <i>forte</i> of the writer, and we regret that we have not room to quote it at full
    length.</p>

    <p>Such are the only specimens which our limits enable us to present to the reader;
    but we hope they will be sufficient to induce him to turn to the work
    itself&mdash;and we doubt not&mdash;for his further gratification. Digressions occur
    too frequently to suit the pioneering taste of a certain class of readers; they may
    serve as resting-places in an intricate plot, but they were not, on that account,
    wanted here. At the same time, they are recommended by plain sense, knowledge of the
    world, shrewdness, and harmless satire on the weak sides of our nature, and are
    therefore <i>useful</i>; whilst their terseness and vivacity will free them from the
    charge of dulness, or the sin of prosing.</p>

    <h3>DIALOGUES ON FLY FISHING.</h3>

    <h4><i>By Sir Humphry Davy.</i></h4>

    <p>We continue our extracts from this "philosophical angler's" delightful little
    book. The present will serve such as are unacquainted with the mysteries of
    fly-fishing, and interest all who are fond of inquiries in natural history.</p>

    <h4><i>Management of Flies.</i></h4>

    <p><i>Hal</i>&mdash;Whilst you are preparing I will mention a circumstance which
    every accomplished fly-fisher ought to know. You changed your flies on Saturday with
    the change of weather, putting the dark flies on for the bright gleams of the sun,
    and the gaudy flies when the dark clouds appeared. Now I will tell you of another
    principle which it is as necessary to know as the change of flies for change of
    weather; I allude to the different kinds of fly to be used in particular pools, and
    even for particular parts of pools. You have fished in this deep pool; and if you
    were to change it for a shallower one, such as that above, it would be proper to use
    smaller flies of the same colour; and in a pool still deeper, larger flies; likewise
    in the rough rapid at the top, a larger fly may be used than below at the tail of the
    water; and in the Tweed, or Tay, I have often changed my fly thrice in the same pool,
    and sometimes with success&mdash;using three different flies for the top, middle, and
    bottom. I remember when I first saw Lord Somerville adopt this fashion, I thought
    there was fancy in it; but experience <span class="pagenum"><a id="page142"
    name="page142"></a>[pg 142]</span> soon proved to me how accomplished a salmon-fisher
    was my excellent and lamented friend, and I adopted the lesson he taught me, and with
    good results, in all bright waters.</p>

    <h4><i>Hooks.</i></h4>

    <p><i>Hal</i>&mdash;I never use any hooks for salmon-fishing, except those which I am
    sure have been made by O'Shaughnessy, of Limerick; for even the hooks made in Dublin,
    though they seldom break, yet they now and then bend; and the English hooks made of
    cast steel in imitation of Irish ones are the worst of all. <i>There</i> is a fly
    nearly of the same colour as that which is destroyed; and I can tell you that I saw
    it made at Limerick by O'Shaughnessy himself, and tied on one of his own hooks.
    Should you catch with it a fish even of 30 lbs., I will answer for its strength and
    temper; it will neither break nor bend.&mdash;We should have such hooks in England,
    but the object of the fishing-tackle makers is to obtain them cheap, and most of
    their hooks are made to sell, and good hooks cannot be sold but at a good
    price.&mdash;The early Fellows of the Royal Society, who attended to all the useful
    and common arts, even improved fish-hooks; and Prince Rupert, an active member of
    that illustrious body, taught the art of tempering hooks to a person of the name of
    Kirby, under whose name, for more than a century, very good hooks were sold.</p>

    <h4><i>Variety in Trout.</i></h4>

    <p><i>Phys.</i>&mdash;Tell us why they are so different from the river-trout, or why
    there should be two species or varieties in the same water.&mdash;<i>Hal.</i> Your
    question is a difficult one, and it has already been referred to in a former
    conversation; but I shall repeat what I stated before, that qualities occasioned by
    food, peculiarities of water, &amp;c. are transmitted to the offspring, and produce
    varieties which retain their characters as long as they are exposed to the same
    circumstances, and only slowly lose them. Plenty of good food gives a silvery colour
    and round form to fish, and the offspring retain these characters. Feeding on
    shell-fish thickens the stomach, and in many generations, probably, the gillaroo
    trout becomes so distinct a variety, as to render it doubtful if it be not a distinct
    species. Even these smallest salmon trout have green backs, <i>only</i> black spots,
    and silvery bellies; from which it is evident that they are the offspring of lake
    trout, or <i>lachs forelle</i>, as it is called by the Germans; whilst the river
    trout, even when 4 or 5 lbs., as we see in one of these fish, though in excellent
    season, have red spots.</p>

    <h4><i>Char.</i></h4>

    <p><i>Phys.</i> The char<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a
    href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> is a most beautiful and excellent fish, and is, of
    course, a fish of prey. Is he not an object of sport to the angler?&mdash;<i>Hal.</i>
    They generally haunt deep, cool lakes, and are seldom found at the surface till late
    in the autumn. When they are at the surface they will, however, take either fly or
    minnow. I have known some caught in both these ways; and have myself taken a char,
    even in summer, in one of those beautiful, small, deep lakes in the Upper Tyrol, near
    Nazereit; but it was where a cool stream entered from the mountain; and the fish did
    not rise, but swallowed the artificial fly under water. I have fished for them in
    many lakes, without success, both in England and Scotland, and also amongst the Alps;
    and I am told the only sure way of taking them is by sinking a line with a bullet,
    and a hook having a live minnow attached to it, in the deep water which they usually
    haunt; and in this way, likewise, I have no doubt the <i>umbla</i>, or <i>ombre
    chevalier</i>, might be taken.</p>

    <h4><i>Naturalization of Fish.</i></h4>

    <p><i>Hal.</i> At Lintz, on the Danube, I could have given you a fish dinner of a
    different description, which you might have liked as a variety. The four kinds of
    perch, the <i>spiegil carpfen</i>, and the <i>siluris glanis</i>; all good fish, and
    which I am sorry we have not in England, where I doubt not they might be easily
    naturalized, and where they would form an admirable addition to the table in inland
    counties. Since England has become Protestant, the cultivation of fresh water fish
    has been much neglected. The <i>burbot</i>, or <i>lotte</i>, which already exists in
    some of the streams tributary to the Trent, and which is a most admirable fish, might
    be diffused without much difficulty; and nothing could be more easy than to
    naturalize the <i>spiegil carpfen</i> and <i>siluris</i>; and I see no reason why the
    <i>perca lucio perca</i> and <i>zingil</i> should not succeed in some of our clear
    lakes and ponds, which abound in coarse fish. The new Zoological Society, I hope,
    will attempt something of this kind; and it will be a better object than introducing
    birds and beasts of prey&mdash;though I have no objection to any sources of rational
    amusement or philosophical curiosity.</p>

    <h4><i>Conveying Fish.</i></h4>

    <p><i>Phys.</i>&mdash;In Austria, the art of carrying and keeping fish is better
    understood than in England. Every inn has a box containing grayling, trout, carp, or
    char, into which water from a spring runs; and no <span class="pagenum"><a
    id="page143" name="page143"></a>[pg 143]</span> one thinks of carrying or sending
    <i>dead</i> fish for a dinner. A fish-barrel full of cool water, which is replenished
    at every fresh source amongst these mountains, is carried on the shoulders of the
    fisherman. And the fish, when confined in wells, are fed with bullock's liver, cut
    into fine pieces, so that they are often in better season in the tank or stew than
    when they were taken. I have seen trout, grayling, and char even, feed voraciously,
    and take their food almost from the hand. These methods of carrying and preserving
    fish have, I believe, been adopted from the monastic establishments. At Admondt, in
    Styria, attached to the magnificent monastery of that name, are abundant ponds and
    reservoirs for every species of fresh water fish; and the char, grayling, and trout
    are preserved in different waters&mdash; covered, enclosed, and under lock and
    key.</p>

    <h3>PAROCHIAL HISTORIES.</h3>

    <p>We wonder why clergymen do not oftener write accounts of their parishes; not mere
    statistical accounts, though these are most valuable, as witness the contributions of
    the Scottish Clergy to the truly patriotic Sir John Sinclair's work; but accounts
    comprehending every thing interesting to all human beings, whatever be their
    political or religious creed. A description of a church that has principally ceased
    to exist, is in general very, very, very dry; inscriptions on tombstones, without
    comment, or moral, are hard reading; an old pan dug up among rubbish proves a sore
    affliction in the hands of the antiquary, and twenty pages quarto, with plates, about
    a rusty spur without a rowel, is, in our humble opinion, an abuse of the art of
    printing. But how easy&mdash;how pleasant, to mix up together all sorts of
    information in due proportions into one whole, in the shape of an
    octavo&mdash;epitomizing every kind of history belonging to the parish, from peer's
    palace to peasant's hut! What are clergymen perpetually about? Not always preaching
    and praying; or marrying, christening, and burying people. They ought to tell us all
    about it; to moralize, to poetize, to philosophize; to paint the manners living as
    they rise, or dead as they fall; to take Time by the forelock, and measure the marks
    of his footsteps; to show us the smoke curling up from embowered chimneys; or, since
    woods must go down, to record the conquests of the biting axe; to celebrate the
    raising of every considerable roof-tree, to lament all dilapidations and crumbling
    away of ivied walls; to inform us how many fathoms deep is the lake with its abbeyed
    island&mdash;why the pool below the aged bridge gets shallower and shallower every
    year, so that it can no more shelter a salmon&mdash;what are the sports, and games,
    and pastimes of the parishioners&mdash;what books they read, if any&mdash;if the
    punishment of the stocks be obsolete&mdash;or the stang&mdash;or the jougs&mdash;if
    the bowels of the people yearn after strange doctrine&mdash;if the parish has
    produced any good or great murderer, incendiary, or other criminal. In short, why
    might not the history of each of the twenty or thirty thousand parishes of Great
    Britain&mdash;we speak at random&mdash;be each a history of human nature, at once
    entertaining and instructive? How infinitely better such books than pamphlets on
    political economy, for example, now encumbering the whole land! Nay, even than single
    sermons, or bundles of sermons, all like so many sticks&mdash;strong when tied all
    together, but when taken separately, weak and frush. We have no great opinion of
    county histories in general, though we believe there are some goodish ones, from
    which we purpose, ere long, to construct some superior articles. A county history, to
    be worth much, should run from sixty to six hundred volumes. No library could well
    stand that for many years. But a judicious selection might be made from the thirty
    thousand parish histories&mdash;that would afford charming reading to the largest
    family during the longest nights&mdash;in the intervals between the Scotch Novels.
    Form the circle round the fire&mdash;when winter crimps and freezes&mdash;or round
    the open bow-window, now that summer roasts and broils, and get her whose voice is
    like a silver bell to read it up, right on from beginning to end, only skipping a few
    lists of names now and then, and we pledge our credit on the prediction, that you
    will be delighted as on a summer ramble, now in sunlight and now in moonlight, over
    hill and dale, adorned with towers, turrets, pinnacles of halls and churches, and the
    low roofs,&mdash;blue or brown, slated or strawed.&mdash;</p>

    <h3>POLITE EVIDENCE.</h3>

    <p>At the Wells assizes, the other day, a butcher's wife, in giving her evidence,

    defy the skill of every man in the court, even if assisted by the greater sagacity of
    the other sex, in finding out what his signature could possibly be meant for. The
    post-offices indeed, knew that a certain number of straight strokes, up and down,
    meant W. Curtis; but probably that was not because they could read the signature, but
    because nothing else at all like it ever came there.</p>

    <p>The <i>Weedsport Advertiser</i> (an American Journal) relates an incident which
    had just occurred in the town of Cato, Cross Lake. A young man named Stockwell, son
    of a widow woman of that name, living in the town, after repeated threats to kill a
    favourite cat belonging to the house, in order to vex his mother, at length undertook
    to carry them into execution. In the morning he took the cat and started with her
    into the woods, telling his youngest sister that he was going to destroy her. They
    were absent until the afternoon, when the cat came home, <i>apparently looking</i> as
    though she had been in the water. The next morning the young man's clothes were seen
    on the bank of Cross Lake, and in the water was found his body, the face and shoulder
    dreadfully scratched, evidently by the cat in struggling, so that little doubt
    existed that he was drowned in attempting to destroy puss. All speculation on the
    matter, however, was set at rest on the body being brought home, for the cat flew at
    the corpse, and could with difficulty be kept off.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
